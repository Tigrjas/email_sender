# Email Sender

The purpose of this project is to be able to send emails using python.

## Using Email Sender
Change the variables either manually or through dotenv module. Anywhere with "REPLACE" is where you would alter the variable. 

A second option of sending the email through the command line exists. Must send the recipient email, subject line, and body text
```
python email_sender.py john@gmail.com Greetings "It was a pleasure to meet you"
```

## Note
If using google you have to have 2 step authentication on and then use the app password instead of your normal password.
